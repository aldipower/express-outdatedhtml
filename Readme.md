Replace HTML5-element-names with proven old ones to reach IE compatibility, on-the-fly during view render.
  
Make sites outdated by replace the new HTML5-element-names, such as 'canvas', 'section', etc. with proven ones like 'div'.
This is happening on-the-fly by parsing the 'view render results'-string of the Express-framework.
Of course, only if an outdated browser is detected, in this case the Internet Explorer smaller than 9, so the browser can handle the retrieved HTML correctly.
Otherwise the Internet Explorer (smaller 9) discards all unknown elements and you can't see anything on your website.

### Installation

Install node.js (http://nodejs.org) first, then npm (http://npmjs.org), then Express (http://expressjs.com):

    $ npm install express-outdatedhtml

or to access the module install globally:

    $ npm install -g express-outdatedhtml

### Usage

```javascript
var outdatedhtml = require('express-outdatedhtml');
```

Simply pass the 'makeoutdated'-function as third argument to the Express view render function.
The 'makeoutdated'-function returns a callback for the render function.

There is an automatically detection which browser type is used and the replacement is only done while using the Internet Explorer smaller 9.

```javascript
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    res.render('index.jade', 
		    	{ title: 'My Site' },
		    	outdatedhtml.makeoutdated(req, res)
    );
});
```

If you want to force the replacement with any browser, you can set the third argument to 'true'.

```javascript
outdatedhtml.makeoutdated(req, res, true)
```

You also can pass another view render callback for further processing.

```javascript
outdatedhtml.makeoutdated(req, res, viewrendercallback)
``` 

### Arguments

outdatedhtml.makeoutdated(req, res, [force, [viewrendercallback]])
